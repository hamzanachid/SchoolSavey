## SchoolSavey
SchoolSavey is a web application designed to assist theaters and administrators in managing student information such as notes, absences, and personal details.

I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap in the Front end to create the user interface. I employed Java technologies such as JSP (JavaServer Pages), Servlet, and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for the Back end.

The application's database is built on PostgreSQL.
